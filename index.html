	 Joseph Conrad (born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, Polish: [ˈjuzɛf tɛˈɔdɔr ˈkɔnrat kɔʐɛˈɲɔfskʲi] (About this soundlisten);
	 3 December 1857 – 3 August 1924) was a Polish-British writer[2][note 1] regarded as one of the greatest novelists to write in the 
	 English language.[5] Though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he was a master prose stylist who brought a 
	 non-English sensibility into English literature.[note 2] Conrad wrote stories and novels, many with a nautical setting, that 
	 depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of what he saw as an impassive, inscrutable universe.[note 3]Conrad is considered
	 an early modernist,[note 4] though his works contain elements of 19th-century realism.[10] His narrative style and anti-heroic 
	 characters, as in Lord Jim, for example,[11] have influenced numerous authors, and many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, 
	 his works. Numerous writers and critics have commented that Conrad's fictional works, written largely in the first two decades of the 
	 20th century, seem to have anticipated later world events.[note 5]Writing near the peak of the British Empire, Conrad drew, among 
	 other things, on his native Poland's national experiences[17][note 6] and on his own experiences in the French and British merchant
	 navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world—including imperialism and colonialism—and
	 that profoundly explore the human psyche.[19]
